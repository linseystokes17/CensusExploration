# CensusExploration
This repository contains 3 Jupyter notebook files - one for each member of our team -  with the MASTER_census_data_etl_and_visualizations being the combination of all three of our notebooks (based off of Abby's original notebook). Within each of those files we have called the Census APIs found at this link: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html. Individually we each cleaned, filtered, and processed the 4 datasets to create charts that give insight into the technology sector. Specifically, this was done by filtering the North American Industry Classification System Label to only show items labelled 'Professional, scientific, and technical services'. 

Some insights we acheived are: demographics such as race and gender over industry owners and employees, specific technologies used such as Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, and numerical statistics such as annual payroll and number of employees.

This repository also contains the PowerPoint presentation of our preliminary exploration charts.
